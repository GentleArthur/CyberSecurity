Our solution won first place in a CyberSecurity competition.Our method has a higher signal-to-noise ratio compared to other methods (e.g., using CTCLoss), and this method is implemented in two main steps.As a first step, a Comparatively fine search is applied to find a subsequence that is similar to the target command.In the second step,add loss functions and control their weights only for the sequences that need to be updated.This is a very simple logic and takes only 40 minutes to 2 hours to produce each high SNR adversarial example.Information on all of the adversarial samples we have produced can be viewed in AESInfo.txt.This file includes the adversarial sample file name, the attack results, the signal-to-noise ratio, and the target command.The whole process can be described as follows:
Our most prominent code can be seen in CEL.py.Different samples and different target orders require different number of iterations.
